# boxcoxmix: An R package for response transformations for random effects and variance component models

`boxcoxmix` provides Box-Cox-type transformations for linear and logistic models with random effects using non-parametric profile maximum likelihood estimation. The main functions are `optim.boxcox` for linear models with random effects and `boxcoxtype` for logistic models with random effects.
